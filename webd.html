    <h1>My first web development project!</h1>
    <p>Hello dear reader, and welcome to my web page! This is my very first time creating something like this, 
    so i hope that it turns out well.  Let's get started!</p>
    <h2>Silly Animals</h2>
    <p>One thing that i realised while making this was that the most difficult part about creating a website is 
        choosing what it's going to be about. Should i talk about Nazis? How about a game or a movie? Music should be good too 
        right? After a good 20 minutes of thinking i decided something - the first video i see when i open youtube will 
        be my topic. And the outcome? silly little animals, something that i cannot imagine anyone hating XD
